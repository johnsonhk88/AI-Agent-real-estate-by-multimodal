# AI Real Estate Agent by Multimodal
## Description
The AI Real Estate Agent is an advanced intelligent system designed to assist users in finding, buying, and renting properties, while also leveraging data science techniques to analyze real estate market trends. By utilizing multimodal AI capabilities, it combines text, images, voice, and other data formats to deliver a comprehensive and intuitive user experience.

## Features
1. Real Estate Search
    - Enable users to search properties based on flexible criteria such as location, price, type, size, and more.  

2. Multimodal Interaction
    - Support inputs via text, voice, and images. Use Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal AI techniques for analyzing real estate data and trends to answer user queries and provide personalized recommendations.

3. Data Science Analysis
    - Analyze historical price data and economic indicators to detect market trends, forecast future prices, and generate actionable insights.Use Database to store the search result dataset for data analysis

4. AI Agent Coordination
    - Employ a multi-agent AI framework to orchestrate specialized agents focused on search, data analysis, scheduling, and interactive user communication.

5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Understand and respond to conversational user inquiries about properties, market trends, and related topics using advanced NLP techniques.

6. Web Data Retrieval and RAG
    - Use web search, web scraping, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to dynamically find and extract real estate data from online sources to enrich responses.

7. Complex Analysis via AI Agents
    - Implement reaction process workflows within the AI agent framework to tackle complex analytical problems through collaboration.

8. Image Recognition and Analysis
    - Analyze property images to extract features and provide visual insights and recommendations.

9. Real-Time Data Integration
    - Access and aggregate real-time property listings and market trend data via APIs or data feeds.

10. User Personalization
    - Tailor recommendations and insights based on individual user preferences and behavioral patterns.

11. Interactive Dashboard
    - Provide a user-friendly dashboard to visualize market data, compare properties, and track user interactions and analysis results.

    - Cross-platform web and mobile app featuring chat, voice input, and image upload capabilities.

2. AI Agent Framework
    - Utilize multi-agent systems such as CrewAI to design agents with distinct roles and responsibilities for modular and scalable intelligence.

3. Natural Language Processing
    - Leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for query understanding, dialogue management, and response generation.

4. Computer Vision Models
    - Integrate models like CLIP or custom CNNs for analyzing property images.

5. Speech Recognition & Synthesis
    - Support voice interaction via ASR and TTS systems.

6. Data Science Module
    - Collect and clean historical real estate price data and relevant economic indicators.
    - Apply machine learning models (e.g., regression, time-series forecasting) to analyze trends and deliver predictions.

7. Property Data Management
    - Design scalable databases or API integrations to handle property listings and associated metadata.

8. Scheduling and Notification System
    - Incorporate calendar API integrations to facilitate property viewing appointment setup and reminders.
